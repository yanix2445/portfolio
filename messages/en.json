        "p1": "I'm *Yanis Mohamed-Amine Harrat*, an **energetic and social \"bon vivant\"** with a deep passion for understanding how technology works at its core. My journey is defined by a **double dimension**: balancing the technical rigor of **Systems & Networks (BTS SIO SISR)** with the advanced logic and algorithmic grit of **Ecole 42 Paris**. I don't just use tech; I deconstruct it, build it, and live it.",
        "p2": "From my first lines of code to **self-hosting** my own ecosystems, I've always been drawn to the **Open Source** philosophy. I believe in technology that is accessible, communal, and transparent. My interests are continuously evolving, currently centered around the frontiers of **AI** and **Cybersecurity**.",
        "p3": "Outside the terminal, I'm a **hyperactive sports enthusiast**. Whether I'm tackling a complex infrastructure problem or pushing my limits on the field, I bring the same \"all-in\" energy. I thrive on social connection and believe that the best solutions are born from collective intelligence and a positive, high-energy atmosphere."
